## Problem Description


You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0

Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 105
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 104

SOLUTION

Language- C++

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buyPrice = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (buyPrice > prices[i]) {
                buyPrice = prices[i];
            }

            profit = max(profit, prices[i] - buyPrice);
        }

        return profit;        
    }
};
